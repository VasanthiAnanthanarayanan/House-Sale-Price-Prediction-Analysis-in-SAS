# House-Sale-Price-Prediction-Analysis-in-SAS
The aim of this project is to predict sale prices of house using data visualization in SAS &amp; Machine Learning technique like Linear Regression using various  selection methods and creating interaction between variables. Data Visualization will basically enable us to get an insight among various variables in the dataset whereas Machine learning techniques using various  selection methods help us to figure out important variables in the dataset that contribute to predicting House prices. In this project, we not only predict the Sale Price of the house but also predict its Bonus eligibility using Logistic Regression model.  Bonus variable basically tells us if the house is sold for Profit or Loss.
